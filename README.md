# Citizen Connect Proxy branch

This branch in the repo is purely for setting up an Apache based proxy to test that the site proxies as we expect it to, and to make it easier for us (mySociety) to have our own proxy to test against.

This branch is an orphan, and contains no code relating to the project. It is just a convenient container for notes, Apache config etc.

You almost certainly want another branch, may I suggest [master](https://github.com/mysociety/citizenconnect)?
