We&apos;re sorry to read of your experience as this is not the experience we want for our patients, and in fact the vast majority do report receiving good to excellent care. We aim to ensure the patients are triaged by a nurse within 15 mins of their arrival to ascertain the severity of their condition. Unfortunately there can be some delays in the subsequent medical review, but again we aim to ensure this is undertaken within 1 hour of arrival. We would like to investigate why this didn&apos;t happen on your visit and would ask that you contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) which is available to listen to concerns, suggestions or queries and can help sort out problems quickly on your behalf. You can contact PALS by telephone on 01737 231958, email: pals@sash.nhs.uk, or by writing to: PALS, East Surrey Hospital, Canada Avenue, Redhill, Surrey RH1 5RH.",
