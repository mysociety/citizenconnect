        "content": "I was referred to the hospital by my GP as I was poorly at 20 weeks pregnant and needed blood tests.  I went to the phlebotomy area of the hospital to have my bloods taken.  In the hour that I waited, there were no staff members present at the desk to help patients.  Patients were helping other patients by explaining that they needed to take a number from the wall and wait. When my number was finally called I had been waiting for over an hour and as soon as I walked into the bloods area the phlebotomist looked at my belly and abruptly said in a condescending tone that I was an antenatal person so she couldn't take my bloods and I must go to antenatal clinic.  She was not apologetic for my waiting for over an hour and clearly wanted to be rid of me.  It would have taken her 2 minutes to take the simple blood test but instead I had to ask another member of staff for directions to the antenatal clinic because the phlebotomist had literally turned her back on me.  I was already feeling poorly and felt even weaker after having waited for over an hour only to be rudely sent away with no assistance offered.  I strongly feel there should have been staff at the front desk in the phlebotomy area to assist patients and failing that, a sign in the area directing pregnant women who need bloods taken to go to the antenatal clinic.",
