I felt I never had enough time to go into details about everything I was experiencing, I felt like I was being rushed and pushed out of the door, I have been having a lot of symptoms due to both the Tonsils and the Adenoids.

A Tonsillectomy was agreed but as I wasn&apos;t able to go into details regarding my symptoms that are being caused by my Adenoids my Adenoids are not being removed and obviously once I have my Tonsils removed I will still have problems in the future which would mean me having to get referred again by my GP to see another ENT Consultant which would probably mean that I would have to have another operation in future to have my Adenoids removed, This would defeat the object and waste valuable time and money as I know Adenoids can be removed at the same time the Tonsils are removed.</div><div id="commentTags"><ul><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RN325&amp;tag=Referrals">Referrals</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RN325&amp;tag=Tonsillectomy">Tonsillectomy</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RN325&amp;tag=Consultants">Consultants</a></li></ul></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you with the cleanliness of the area you were treated in?</questionText><answerText>Fairly satisfied</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Doctors and nurses worked well together…</questionText><answerText>all of the time</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that you were treated with dignity and respect by the staff?</questionText><answerText>all of the time</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that you were involved in decisions about your care?</questionText><answerText>Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied</answerText><answerMetric value="3" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that the hospital provides same-sex accommodation?</questionText><answerText>Fairly satisfied</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">81055</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid></entry><entry><id>81049</id><title type="text">Simply the Best hospital care I have experienced ever.

I thought this was appalingly incompetent and reckless.

I waited in the corridor on a stretcher for my x ray.THe nurses were talking amongst themselves about how dirty the hospital was and that it was an &amp;quot;infectious area&amp;quot;.

I arrived at 2pm.they thought I may have ruputured my spleen or have internal bleeding.they requested a surgeon at 7pm and I did not see a doctor until 1am.10 hours after they first thought I had internal bleeding.

I was kept in overnight.the orthapedic registrar told me I would be better in 6 weeks,I could drive immediately and horse ride in 2 week. After visiting the fracture clinic I was told 3 months until my fractures heal, I can not drive and certainly not horse ride for several months. How could a orthapedic doctor be so wrong?

There is a lack of communication betwee nurses,doctor and patient. Although staff are friendly they are overstretcged and neglect patients.

I have to stay that the staff are very caring and so kind not just to myself but to everyone on the ward from old to young patients. I am cared for by all the nurses, and every single member of the team give that little bit extra care that I have never found in any other hospital from Sunderland to York, Middlesbrough to Darlington!
I would like to mention a particular member of staff on the ward The ward is the most cleanest ive ever been in and its down to her and others that make my stay a very comfortable one where every inch arouns my bed and bathrooms etc is so clean that its like being at home.
I do not want to put down other hospitals but I have never expericence such a through domectic who while cleaning takes the time to have a little chat with you and you never hear her complaining, she gets on with ther works and does such a great job.
I have picked up MRSA from other hopsitals but with the work they and others puts in I have never picked up this nasty bug from the Freemans and im in this hospital a good few times.
I would like to say if it were not for the treatment of being able to come home and administer my own iv anitibitoucs through a line in my arm I would not be able to go on with my work commitments, study and home life. This opportunity of being able to come out of hospital helps so much as I am only 25 years old and if this wasnt availble I would become withdrwn from everyday life and would probably not have a job.

Thank you too everyone on ward 29.</div><div id="improved">If I had to really nit pick it would be that the corrdiors in soem of the hospital are too warm.
The meals, cleanliness, staff, porters, domestics are just brilliant in the Freemans so the only thing I could find to improve is the heat in the corridors!</div><div id="anythingElse">My Doctor, you cant faul,t he&apos;s someone who makes it their job to get to the bottom of your illness, obviously this is what Doctors are suppose to do, but he is different and just doesnt just pass you down the conveyor belt of the NHS of basically passing you onto some other doctor when they dont know whats wrong with you. He actually cares, takes an interest in you and also your work and home life.
I have had problems with my health all my life and he and his team are the only ones who are actually trying to &apos;sort&apos; me out and find out the cause.</div><div id="commentTags"><ul><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Patient care">Patient care</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Doctors">Doctors</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Nursing staff">Nursing staff</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Cleanliness">Cleanliness</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Bathroom">Bathroom</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Food">Food</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Porters">Porters</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD01&amp;tag=Corridors">Corridors</a></li></ul></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>Overall rating</questionText><answerText>I'd recommend this hospital</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Option" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you with the cleanliness of the area you were treated in?</questionText><answerText>exceptionally clean</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Doctors and nurses worked well together…</questionText><answerText>all of the time</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that you were treated with dignity and respect by the staff?</questionText><answerText>all of the time</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that you were involved in decisions about your care?</questionText><answerText>all of the time</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that the hospital provides same-sex accommodation?</questionText><answerText>Very satisfied</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">81019</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid></entry><entry><id>81016</id><title type="text">Grin and bear it!</title><published>2011-06-28T17:50:05+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-29T12:59:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Organisation commented on" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/41533?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Orthopaedics" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/services/types/srv0073/co300?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="self" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Grin and bear it!" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/41533/comments/81016?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Original comment on NHS Choices website" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RQ8L0" /><link rel="report" type="text/html" title="Report this comment as offensive or unsuitable" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/comments.aspx?contentId=81016&amp;AreaId=5&amp;type=p" /><category term="comment" label="Whether this is a comment, reply or deletion" scheme="commentType" /><content type="xhtml"><div id="liked">I can&apos;t say I really liked any of it.

2. Are Costa coffee, WHSmith, M&amp;amp;S Simply Food more important than the actual patient? It&apos;s easier to pop into M&amp;amp;S Food to get something for dinner than actually get to where you need to go for hospital treatment.
3. How can the fracture clinic be running nearly 2hrs late when your actual appointment is for 11am?
4. I would think it common courtesy to advise that a clinic is running so far behind. Not leave patients lingering, wearily hoping that they will get seen eventually.
5. Would the hospital like patients to turn up as and when they please for appointments, perhaps if they did the hospital might realise how frustrating and annoying it can be.</div><div id="anythingElse">The new part of this hospital is impressive yet it is merely a facade.

 The biggest issue is however the lack of awareness and signage about the minor injuries unit. I did not know it was there and talking to other people in the area this seems quite common. One person who was aware of it only thought it was open 9-5

As you drive up the road it says no A and E (which I understand) but makes no mention of the minor injuries unit. Even when I went up to the door I wasn&apos;t sure whether anything was open.

We&amp;apos;re sorry to read of your experience as this is not the experience we want for our patients, and in fact the vast majority do report receiving good to excellent care. We aim to ensure the patients are triaged by a nurse within 15 mins of their arrival to ascertain the severity of their condition. Unfortunately there can be some delays in the subsequent medical review, but again we aim to ensure this is undertaken within 1 hour of arrival. We would like to investigate why this didn&amp;apos;t happen on your visit and would ask that you contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) which is available to listen to concerns, suggestions or queries and can help sort out problems quickly on your behalf. You can contact PALS by telephone on 01737 231958, email: pals@sash.nhs.uk, or by writing to: PALS, East Surrey Hospital, Canada Avenue, Redhill, Surrey RH1 5RH.</content><in-reply-to ref="78027" type="xhtml" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/42066/comments/78027?apikey=APIKEY" postingid="48707" postingorganisationid="1" xmlns="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0" /><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">78027</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid></entry><entry><id>80985</id><title type="text">Horrible,rude,not caring,midwifes are rubbish</title><published>2011-06-28T15:16:30+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-28T15:31:41+01:00</updated><author><name>Anonymous</name></author><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Organisation commented on" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/42682?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="self" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Horrible,rude,not caring,midwifes are rubbish" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/42682/comments/80985?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Original comment on NHS Choices website" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RWEAK" /><link rel="report" type="text/html" title="Report this comment as offensive or unsuitable" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/comments.aspx?contentId=80985&amp;AreaId=5&amp;type=p" /><category term="comment" label="Whether this is a comment, reply or deletion" scheme="commentType" /><content type="xhtml"><div id="liked">Leaving</div><div id="improved">staff that actually cared and had good communication skills and understood peoples needs</div><div id="anythingElse">i would never ever recommend this hospital to anyone i was admitted to ward 30 and was left in my room for 3 days. the midwifes came and said the doctor would be round shortly and the doctors never came when i went out of my room to the desk they were all in the office chatting when 3 buzzers were going off and then they greeted me with rudeness.the care i was given was appalling i was 33 weeks pregnant and told my partner i did not want to have our baby at this hospital and we are now at the royal which is fantastic.

I went to the phlebotomy area of the hospital to have my bloods taken.  In the hour that I waited, there were no staff members present at the desk to help patients.  Patients were helping other patients by explaining that they needed to take a number from the wall and wait. When my number was finally called I had been waiting for over an hour and as soon as I walked into the bloods area the phlebotomist looked at my belly and abruptly said in a condescending tone that I was an antenatal person so she couldn&apos;t take my bloods and I must go to antenatal clinic.  She was not apologetic for my waiting for over an hour and clearly wanted to be rid of me.  It would have taken her 2 minutes to take the simple blood test but instead I had to ask another member of staff for directions to the antenatal clinic because the phlebotomist had literally turned her back on me.  I was already feeling poorly and felt even weaker after having waited for over an hour only to be rudely sent away with no assistance offered.  I strongly feel there should have been staff at the front desk in the phlebotomy area to assist patients and failing that, a sign in the area directing pregnant women who need bloods taken to go to the antenatal clinic.</div><div id="commentTags"><ul><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RYQ30&amp;tag=Referrals">Referrals</a></li><li class="commentTag"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RYQ30&amp;tag=Blood test">Blood test</a></li></ul></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you with the cleanliness of the area you were treated in?</questionText><answerText>clean</answerText><answerMetric value="3" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How satisfied are you that you were treated with dignity and respect by the staff?</questionText><answerText>Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied</answerText><answerMetric value="3" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">80942</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid></entry><entry><id>80800R</id><title type="text">The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust replies:</title><published>2011-06-28T08:21:14+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-28T08:21:14+01:00</updated><author><name>The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</name></author><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Organisation commented on" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/41863?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Accident and emergency services" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/services/types/srv0001/co94782?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="self" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust replies:" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/hospitals/41863/comments/80800R?apikey=APIKEY" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Original comment on NHS Choices website" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/hospitals/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=RTD02" /><link rel="report" type="text/html" title="Report this comment as offensive or unsuitable" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/comments.aspx?contentId=80800&amp;AreaId=1&amp;type=t" /><category term="reply" label="Whether this is a comment, reply or deletion" scheme="commentType" /><content type="text">Thank you for posting your comments about your experiences within the Accident and Emergency Department at the RVI.
