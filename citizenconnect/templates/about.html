            <p>Our aim is to try to get problems resolved locally with your NHS provider as far as we can. If you are not satisfied with the final response you received about your problem from the local service provider and feel that all efforts for a local resolution have been exhausted, you may wish to take it further by contacting the Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

            <p>The Health Service Ombudsmanâ€™s role is to investigate complaints that individuals have been treated unfairly or received poor service from the NHS in England.  You can contact them to find out how they can help by:</p>

            <p>You will also need to tell them how you have been affected by the issues you are complaining about (or, if you are complaining on behalf of somebody else, how they have been affected).</p>
