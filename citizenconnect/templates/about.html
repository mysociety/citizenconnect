            <p>Our aim is to try to get problems resolved locally with your NHS provider as far as we can. If you are not satisfied with the final response you received about your problem from the local service provider and feel that all efforts for a local resolution have been exhausted, you may wish to take it further by contacting the Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

            <p>The Health Service Ombudsman’s role is to investigate complaints that individuals have been treated unfairly or received poor service from the NHS in England.  You can contact them to find out how they can help by:</p>

The purpose of the privacy policy is to inform you as a user of Care Connect about what information we collect when you visit the service, how we use the information, whether the information is disclosed and the ways in which we protect users' privacy.</p>
            <p>We want you to feel secure when using Care Connect. We are committed to respecting your privacy. Below is an overview of how we do that.</p>
            <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
            <p>We analyse information to see what is most effective about Care Connect and associated services to help us identify ways to improve it and to make it more effective. We may also use information for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point when we collect the information.</p>
            <h3>What information do we collect when you use NHS Choices?</h3>
            <p>We collect information indirectly and directly.</p>
            <p>When you use Care Connect we use technology to collect information indirectly - such as your internet address. This is commonplace across all internet services to enable the investigation of issues such as malicious use. This information is then kept in our internet access logs.</p>
            <p>We collect information directly from you in a number of ways. One way is by using cookies. Cookies are small files of information that save and retrieve information about your visit to our site, such as how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site and what information was of interest to you. This information is collected for a number of reasons, for example, to help develop the service.</p>
            <p>The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. If you are uncomfortable about the use of cookies, you can disable them by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu in your internet browser. However, disabling cookies may affect our ability to provide services to you; if certain cookies are disabled you may not be able to access the service.</p>
            <p>See our Cookies policy for more information on the cookies we use.</p>
            <p>We also collect information when you give it to us. For example, you may register to use the message-posting facility called 'Patient feedback'. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for information and how this information will be used. It is completely up to you whether you provide it, but not providing information may affect our ability to provide services to you.</p>
            <p>The social media bookmarking sites that Care Connect links to are third-party sites.  Care Connect does not control the way these sites use your information. If you choose to access these sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that may be used by them in accordance with their privacy policies, which may differ from ours.</p>
            <p>You should read their privacy policies carefully to find out what happens to any information that is collected by these services when you use them.</p>
            <p>Information submitted as a part of Care Connect content held on Twitter and Facebook will be subject to their privacy policies.

            <h3>How long do we hold this information?</h3>
            <p>We will hold the information for as long as we are providing you services and as long as your comment is active on our system.</p>
            <p>We will remove all personal information we hold relating to you, which you registered with us, within six months of your comment being deactivated on our system.</p>

            <h3>Will we disclose your information to, or share it with, other organisations?</h3>
            <p>We do not share data with other organisations unless the law permits us to do so. We do not sell individuals’ information. We will share it only with our authorised Data Processors, who must act at all times on our instructions as the Data Controller under the Data Protection Act 1998. Before you submit any information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for specific information and it is up to you whether you provide it.</p>

            <h3>We may give you access to your information</h3>
            <p>You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate.</p>
            <p>You can do this by contacting the Data Protection Officer<!--, XXXX add in address here --></p>

            <h3>Your data is kept under secure conditions</h3>
            <p>We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your data on our service.

            </div>

            <p>Contributions to Care Connect may be moderated, that is, checked to make sure they don’t break our rules. You will need to keep your contributions constructive, relevant and civil. The following rules and guidelines are to protect both you and the NHS, and our moderators will remove contributions that break these rules.</p>

            <h2>Commenting on NHS services (including hospitals, GP practices and dentists)</h2>
            <p>The Care Connect service launches initially as a pilot allowing the public to raise problems, ask questions and share their experiences of NHS service by reviewing and rating services. The pilot will go-live with hospitals in the first instance.  GPs will follow at a later date.</p>
            <p>Share Your Experience - The service you receive from the NHS will never be adversely affected by your feedback on hospitals, GP surgeries, dental practices or any other health provider and you can comment anonymously if you wish. You should respect the anonymity of other patients and staff at the service you are commenting on by not using their names.</p>
            <p>Problems - The service you receive from the NHS will never be adversely affected by the problems you raise regarding hospitals, GP surgeries or any other health provider. You must provide a contact name when raising a problem.  This is to allow a provider to fully investigate your problem.  Your contact details will never be published publicly on the Care Connect site.</p>
            <p>Question – The question service is anonymous and any questions raised are answered by Care Connect case handlers.</p>
            <p>The “Patient feedback” feature for each hospital, GP and dental practice in England is there for you to comment on your, or a friend’s or family member’s, hospital, general practice, dental or other care service. This is not a formal complaint procedure.  If you wish to make a complaint you should read our guide to making a complaint (http://www.nhs.uk/choiceinthenhs/rightsandpledges/complaints/pages/nhscomplaints.aspx).</p>
            <p>NHS trusts and the service providers are not obliged to read the comments, though many do. If you want a reply to your feedback you should contact the provider of the NHS service either directly or through the local Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), listed on the page of the hospital, GP practice, dental practice or other service you have used.</p>
            <p>Giving your feedback on an NHS service does not require registration with Care Connect but as a minimum you will need to provide a valid email address so that we can contact you if there are any problems.</p>
            <p>Care Connect is not suitable for making general political points about NHS services. Feedback from members of staff will not be accepted. Comments must be about events within the past 2 years. Once a previously accepted comment is more than 2 years old, we will indicate this next to the comment.</p>
